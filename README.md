## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Organization Setup
1. **Admin** creates organizations with details (name, account, website, policies)
2. **Admin** assigns available vehicles to organizations
3. **Admin** creates Organization Manager for each organization

### 2. User Management Workflow
1. **Admin** or **Org Manager** creates users (Guards, Drivers)
2. Users are automatically assigned to the creator's organization
3. **Admin** can create users for any organization
4. **Org Manager** can only create users for their organization

### 3. Vehicle Management Process
1. **Admin** adds vehicles to the system (using VIN decoder)
2. **Admin** assigns vehicles to organizations
3. **Org Manager** assigns vehicles to specific drivers
4. **Org Manager** manages vehicle status and availability

### 4. Scheduling System
1. **Org Manager** generates AI-powered schedules
2. System creates optimized shifts for guards and drivers
3. Guards can view driver schedules for verification
4. Drivers can view their own schedules

### 5. Daily Operations
1. **Guards** verify drivers using face recognition
2. **Guards** scan license plates for vehicle verification
3. System logs all entry/exit activities in real-time
4. **Org Managers** monitor daily operations via dashboard

### 6. AI-Powered Features
1. **Admin/Org Manager** registers driver faces in the system
2. **Guards** use face recognition to verify driver identity
3. **Guards** scan license plates for automatic verification
4. System maintains attendance logs and verification records
